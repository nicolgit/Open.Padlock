# What does this project do?

This is an open source password keeper developed in c# and usable on Android, iOS and Windows 10.

# Why is this project useful?

There are many password keeper out there (commercial and free), I have decided to develop my personal one because for this type of tool, availability of the cource code is a plus, and a guarantee. Even if you are not able to read the code, open discussions here can help you to understand if trust this code or not.

This tool also do not have his own cloud, but just save a file on your OneDrive (in future I hope also on other cloud storages
